# Flux CMake starter project #

This is a tiny CMake project to help getting started using the [Flux library](https://github.com/tcbrindle/flux).

It uses CMake's [`FetchContent`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html) to automatically download the latest revision of Flux from the main branch on Github.
